# Asm2Vec

This package is just a heavily modified version of
https://github.com/oalieno/asm2vec-pytorch.

Actually that implementation doesn't even work properly, so I had to make
corrections according to the [original Asm2Vec
paper](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/sp/2019/666000a038/19skfc3ZfKo)
to get things to work right.
